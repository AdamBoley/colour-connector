### Validator Testing


## Deployment


### Version Control
1.	The main repository was forked by all collaborators
2.	Branch protection was added to ensure pull requests were reviewed before merging
3.	Each team member ensured their development environment was linked by using the command:  git remote -v 
4.	For each new feature, team members created a new branch: git checkout -b branch-name
5.	To ensure this branch was being tracked: git push -u origin branch-name
6.	 In order to update the project files in their own work space:  git pull upstream main this was important to limit the amount of merge conflicts a team member came across
7.	Each team member used git add . git commit and git push to add, stage and save their work to their branch. 
8.	When a team member finished a feature they made a Pull Request.  A template was used for this Pull Request so all team members information was structured the same.  This Pull Request was then checked by another member of the team.  If a merge conflict arose the team member would be notified by a comment otherwise the branch was merged.
